            "the firm reassesses and periodi- cally adjusts the underlying inputs and assumptions used in the oas model to reflect market conditions and assumptions that a market par- ticipant would consider in valuing the msr asset .",
            "during the fourth quarter of the 2007 , the firm 2019s proprietary prepayment model was refined to reflect a decrease in estimated future mortgage prepay- ments based upon a number of market related factors including a downward trend in home prices , general tightening of credit under- writing standards and the associated impact on refinancing activity .",
            "the firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available and to recent market activity and actual portfolio experience .",
            "the fair value of msrs is sensitive to changes in interest rates , includ- ing their effect on prepayment speeds .",
            "jpmorgan chase uses or has used combinations of derivatives , afs securities and trading instru- ments to manage changes in the fair value of msrs .",
            "the intent is to offset any changes in the fair value of msrs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments .",
            "msrs decrease in value when interest rates decline .",
            "conversely , securities ( such as mort- gage-backed securities ) , principal-only certificates and certain deriva- tives ( when the firm receives fixed-rate interest payments ) increase in value when interest rates decline .",
            "in march 2006 , the fasb issued sfas 156 , which permits an entity a one-time irrevocable election to adopt fair value accounting for a class of servicing assets .",
            "jpmorgan chase elected to adopt the standard effective january 1 , 2006 , and defined msrs as one class of servicing assets for this election .",
            "at the transition date , the fair value of the msrs exceeded their carrying amount , net of any related valuation allowance , by $ 150 million net of taxes .",
            "this amount was recorded as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of january 1 , 2006 .",
            "msrs are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value , and changes in their fair value are recorded in current- period earnings .",
            "revenue amounts related to msrs and the financial instruments used to manage the risk of msrs are recorded in mortgage fees and related income .",
            "for the year ended december 31 , 2005 , msrs were accounted for under sfas 140 , using a lower of cost or fair value approach .",
            "under this approach , msrs were amortized as a reduction of the actual servicing income received in proportion to , and over the period of , the estimated future net servicing income stream of the underlying mortgage loans .",
            "for purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment of msrs , the firm stratified the portfolio on the basis of the predominant risk characteristics , which are loan type and interest rate .",
            "any indicated impairment was rec- ognized as a reduction in revenue through a valuation allowance , which represented the extent to which the carrying value of an individual stra- tum exceeded its estimated fair value .",
            "any gross carrying value and relat- ed valuation allowance amounts which were not expected to be recov- ered in the foreseeable future , based upon the interest rate scenario , were considered to be other-than-temporary .",
            "prior to the adoption of sfas 156 , the firm designated certain deriva- tives used to risk manage msrs ( e.g. , a combination of swaps , swap- tions and floors ) as sfas 133 fair value hedges of benchmark interest rate risk .",
            "sfas 133 hedge accounting allowed the carrying value of the hedged msrs to be adjusted through earnings in the same period that the change in value of the hedging derivatives was recognized through earnings .",
            "the designated hedge period was daily .",
            "in designat- ing the benchmark interest rate , the firm considered the impact that the change in the benchmark rate had on the prepayment speed esti- mates in determining the fair value of the msrs .",
            "hedge effectiveness was assessed using a regression analysis of the change in fair value of the msrs as a result of changes in benchmark interest rates and of the change in the fair value of the designated derivatives .",
            "the valua- tion adjustments to both the msrs and sfas 133 derivatives were recorded in mortgage fees and related income .",

            "we view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only , as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments .",
            "based upon outstanding balances , and excluding purchased impaired loans , at december 31 , 2011 , for home equity lines of credit for which the borrower can no longer draw ( e.g. , draw period has ended or borrowing privileges have been terminated ) , approximately 4.32% ( 4.32 % ) were 30-89 days past due and approximately 5.57% ( 5.57 % ) were greater than or equal to 90 days past due .",

            "typically , these modifications are for a period of up to 24 months after which the interest rate reverts to the original loan rate .",
            "a permanent modification , with a term greater than 60 months , is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed .",

            "within the confines of the limited decision-making abilities of a qspe under sfas 140 , the operating doc- uments that govern existing subprime securitizations generally authorize the servicer to modify loans for which default is reasonably foreseeable , provided that the modification is in the best interests of the qspe 2019s ben- eficial interest holders , and would not result in a remic violation .",
            "in december 2007 , the american securitization forum ( 201casf 201d ) issued the 201cstreamlined foreclosure and loss avoidance framework for securitized subprime adjustable rate mortgage loans 201d ( 201cthe framework 201d ) .",
            "the framework provides guidance for servicers to stream- line evaluation procedures for borrowers with certain subprime adjustable rate mortgage ( 201carm 201d ) loans to more efficiently provide modifications of such loans with terms that are more appropriate for the individual needs of such borrowers .",
            "the framework applies to all first-lien subprime arm loans that have a fixed rate of interest for an initial period of 36 months or less , are included in securitized pools , were originated between january 1 , 2005 , and july 31 , 2007 , and have an initial interest rate reset date between january 1 , 2008 , and july 31 , 2010 ( 201casf framework loans 201d ) .",
            "the framework categorizes the population of asf framework loans into three segments .",

            "segment 2 includes loans where the borrower is current , is unlikely to be able to refinance into any readily available mortgage industry product and meets certain defined criteria .",
            "segment 3 includes loans where the borrower is not current , as defined , and does not meet the criteria for segments 1 or 2 .",
            "asf framework loans in segment 2 of the framework are eligible for fast-track modification under which the interest rate will be kept at the existing initial rate , generally for five years following the interest rate reset date .",
            "the framework indicates that for segment 2 loans , jpmorgan chase , as servicer , may presume that the borrower will be unable to make payments pursuant to the original terms of the borrower 2019s loan after the initial interest rate reset date .",
            "thus , the firm may presume that a default on that loan by the borrower is reasonably foreseeable unless the terms of the loan are modified .",
            "jpmorgan chase has adopted the loss mitigation approaches under the framework for securitized sub- prime loans that meet the specific segment 2 screening criteria , and it expects to begin modifying segment 2 loans by the end of the first quar- ter of 2008 .",
            "the firm believes that the adoption of the framework will not affect the off-balance sheet accounting treatment of jpmorgan chase-sponsored qspes that hold segment 2 subprime loans .",
