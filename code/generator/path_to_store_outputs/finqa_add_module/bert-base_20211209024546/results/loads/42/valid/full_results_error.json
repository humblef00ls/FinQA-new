            "the lpsc staff ( 1 ) agreed that it was prudent to move the project from long-term suspension to cancellation and that the timing of the decision to suspend on a longer-term basis was not imprudent ; ( 2 ) indicated that , except for $ 0.8 million in compensation-related costs , the costs incurred should be deemed prudent ; ( 3 ) recommended recovery from customers over ten years but stated that the lpsc may want to consider 15 years ; ( 4 ) allowed for recovery of carrying costs and earning a return on project costs , but at a reduced rate approximating the cost of debt , while also acknowledging that the lpsc may consider ordering no return ; and ( 5 ) indicated that entergy louisiana should be directed to securitize project costs , if legally feasible and in the public interest .",
            "in the third quarter 2010 , in accordance with accounting standards , entergy louisiana determined that it was probable that the little gypsy repowering project would be abandoned and accordingly reclassified $ 199.8 million of project costs from construction work in progress to a regulatory asset .",
            "a hearing on the issues , except for cost allocation among customer classes , was held before the alj in november 2010 .",
